This is a ProStock Git Practice repository.

In this tutorial, hoping to learn about how to deploy features safely and effectively.

1) we will clone the master repository in a main area, which should be blank. This will represent our live area.
2) we will create a "test" branch and create a new file/feature that needs to be tested.
3) in a local environment, someone will create this feature to be tested
4) the change, by creating an html file, will be committed and pushed to the test branch.
5) another person can also clone the test brancjh and make a change to contribute.
6) then after everyone pulls the latest versions and the developers are happy, this change will be pulled to the testing area.
7) if the beta-tester is happy with the changes, one of the developers making changes will create a pull request and assign another developer to review the pull.
8) the request is approved, and a merge is made to the master. 

Rebasing is another tool, not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
